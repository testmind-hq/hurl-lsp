> ⚠️ **Work in Progress** — `hurl-lsp` is under active development. Core features are being implemented. Not yet recommended for production use. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

---

## Overview

[Hurl](https://hurl.dev) is a powerful tool for running HTTP requests defined in plain text `.hurl` files. These files are version-controlled alongside your code, making them ideal for API testing in CI/CD pipelines.

Until now, editing `.hurl` files in any editor meant writing in the dark — no completions, no diagnostics, no inline docs. **`hurl-lsp`** fills that gap.

Built in Rust on top of [`tower-lsp`](https://github.com/ebkalderon/tower-lsp) and the official [`hurl_core`](https://crates.io/crates/hurl_core) parser, `hurl-lsp` is currently focused on a solid v0 baseline: core LSP features plus a working VSCode extension.

Current implementation status:

- Rust language server with diagnostics, completions, hover, formatting, outline, and variable definition jump
- VSCode extension with `.hurl` language registration, TextMate grammar, snippets, and language client
- VSCode binary bootstrap for macOS / Linux / Windows
- Zed extension skeleton and Helix setup docs in-repo

Not implemented yet:

- Rich per-assert actual-value inline rendering
- VSCode webview panels
- TestMind integration

---

## Features

### Diagnostics

Real-time diagnostics while editing `.hurl` files:

- Parser-backed syntax errors from `hurl_core`
- Invalid HTTP method detection
- Invalid section name detection
- Undefined variable warnings (`{{variable}}`)
- Duplicate section warnings in one request block
- Invalid `HTTP` status code format detection

### Completion

Context-aware completions triggered automatically:

- **HTTP Methods** — `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, ...
- **Section Keywords** — `[Query]`, `[Form]`, `[Multipart]`, `[Headers]`, `[Captures]`, `[Asserts]`, `[Options]`, ...
- **Assert Functions** — `jsonpath`, `xpath`, `regex`, `header`, `status`, `duration`, ...
- **Content-Type values** — common MIME types for request headers
- **Captured Variables** — `{{` context completion from same-file `[Captures]`

### Hover Documentation

Hover over methods, sections, and assert functions to see short inline docs.

### Go To Definition

Variable references can jump to their same-file `[Captures]` definition.
When workspace variable files exist (`.hurl-vars`, `vars.env`, `hurl.env`, `.env`), definition and diagnostics can also resolve against those files.

### Code Lens

Per-request Code Lens is available with:
- summary line (`method/path`, section counters)
- `▶ Run` action (executes selected request entry via temporary hurl file)
- `⚡ Run with vars` action (uses nearest `.hurl-vars` / `vars.env` / `hurl.env` / `.env` when found)
- `⛓ Run chain` action (executes current entry plus inferred/declared dependencies)
- `📄 Run file` action (executes all request entries in current file)
- `📋 Copy as curl` action (returns generated curl text from request line + headers)

Run alert behavior:

- `hurl.run.inlineFailureDiagnostics`: `true` (default) shows inline red failure diagnostics; set to `false` to disable them
- `Hurl: Clear Run Alerts`: clears current file's run diagnostics immediately

### OpenAPI Path Completion

When `openapi.yaml` / `openapi.yml` / `swagger.yaml` / `swagger.yml` / `swagger.json` is present in the workspace hierarchy,
request lines can use OpenAPI `paths` keys for URL completion.
For mapped operations, request body field names from OpenAPI `requestBody.content.application/json.schema.properties`
are also suggested inside JSON request bodies.

### Built-in Formatter

`Format Document` is backed by official `hurlfmt::format::format_text(..., false)` through LSP.
Use command `Hurl: Format Document` for explicit formatter invocation with runtime logging.

### Markdown Export (VSCode)

Command `Hurl: Export as Markdown` exports current `.hurl` file into a sibling `.md` file.
The export follows outline preferences:

- `hurl.outline.groupMode`: `hierarchical` | `flat`
- `hurl.outline.sortMode`: `source` | `priority`

### Document Outline

The server exposes metadata-first document symbols with request-level fallback:

```
📁 users.hurl
├── 🔗 TC-CHAIN-001 用户完整生命周期 [P0]
│   ├── 🔧 Create user step-setup
│   └── 🧪 Validate user step-test
├── 🟧 P1
│   └── TC-0042 Invalid email
└── ○ GET /health
```

Outline behavior is configurable in VSCode settings:

- `hurl.outline.groupMode`: `hierarchical` keeps chain/priority groups, `flat` shows request entries only
- `hurl.outline.sortMode`: `source` uses file order, `priority` sorts by `P0 > P1 > P2` (with step order `setup > test > teardown`)

In VSCode Explorer, `Hurl Requests` view provides executable request nodes with inline actions:

- `Run` (executes selected request)
- `Run Chain` (executes selected request + inferred/declared dependencies)

## Editor Support

| Editor | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **VSCode** | Implemented | Extension included in `editors/vscode`, with local binary config and cross-platform auto-download flow |
| **Helix** | Implemented (manual setup) | Guide available at `editors/helix/README.md` |
| **Neovim** | Manual setup | Server is usable manually via LSP config |
| **Zed** | Baseline implemented | Minimal extension skeleton in `editors/zed` (publish pending) |

## Platform Support

Current automatic binary management in the VSCode extension supports:

- `aarch64-apple-darwin`
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

---

## Installation

### VSCode

Install the **Hurl** extension from the VS Marketplace (search for `hurl-lsp` / `Hurl`).  
The extension currently auto-downloads binaries on macOS only.

Or install from `.vsix` package generated by the release workflow.

Binary resolution order:

1. Use `hurl.server.path` if configured.
2. Check `hurl-lsp` in local `PATH` and reuse it when version is >= extension version.
3. Otherwise auto-download matching release binary.

Use command `Hurl: Show Log` to open extension/runtime logs.

### Zed

Install the **Hurl** extension from Zed Extensions, then install the binary:

```sh
cargo install hurl-lsp
```

### Helix

Install the binary, then add to `~/.config/helix/languages.toml`:

```toml
[[language]]
name = "hurl"
scope = "source.hurl"
file-types = ["hurl"]
comment-token = "#"
language-servers = ["hurl-lsp"]

[language-server.hurl-lsp]
command = "hurl-lsp"
```

### Neovim

```lua
require('lspconfig').hurl_lsp.setup({
  cmd = { "hurl-lsp" },
  filetypes = { "hurl" },
})
```

---

## Binary Installation

**Via cargo:**

```sh
cargo install hurl-lsp
```

**Via Homebrew** _(tap-based, formula maintained in this repo)_:

```sh
brew tap testmind-hq/tap
brew install hurl-lsp
```

Homebrew formula source: `packaging/homebrew/Formula/hurl-lsp.rb`.

Pre-built binaries for macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), Linux, and Windows are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/testmind-hq/hurl-lsp/releases) page.

## TestMind Integration _(planned)_

CI result feedback integration from TestMind is a future phase and is not implemented in current builds.

- [x] Document state management (`did_open` / `did_change`)
- [x] Syntax diagnostics via `hurl_core`
- [x] HTTP method + section keyword completion
- [x] Assert function completion
- [x] Hover documentation
- [x] Built-in formatter (`hurlfmt`)
- [x] CI (build + test + clippy)

### Phase 2 — Editor Extensions + Distribution

- [x] Multi-platform cross-compilation workflow baseline + GitHub Releases automation
- [x] VSCode extension (syntax highlight + snippets + LSP client + auto binary management)
- [~] Publish to VS Marketplace (workflow prepared: `.github/workflows/publish-vscode.yml`)

## Architecture

`hurl-lsp` is built in **Rust** using:

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| [`tower-lsp`](https://github.com/ebkalderon/tower-lsp) | Async LSP server framework |
| [`hurl_core`](https://crates.io/crates/hurl_core) | Official Hurl parser and AST |
| [`tokio`](https://tokio.rs/) | Async runtime |
| [`dashmap`](https://crates.io/crates/dashmap) | Concurrent document state store |

The server communicates via **stdin/stdout** JSON-RPC, launched as a subprocess by the editor. No daemon, no ports, no configuration required to get started.
